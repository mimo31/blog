It was once during an analysis lecture that my mind wandered off... We were discussing how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_convergence">uniform convergence</a> was stronger than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_convergence">pointwise convergence</a>. However, from the examples we saw, it seemed to me that for a sequence to converge pointwise but not uniformly, it had to have something special about it. So the question is: Just how much do we have to restrict a sequence of functions in order for pointwise convergence to also imply uniform convergence?

So a little problem was born. First, a definition:
</p>
<div class="summary-box">
	<div class="summary-box-title">Definition (\(\lambda\)-Lipschitz)</div>
	<div class="summary-box-insides">
		Let \(\lambda\in\rr,\lambda&gt;0\) and \(f\) be a function \(f:D\to\rr\) for some \(D\subseteq \rr\). We say that \(f\) is \(\lambda\)-Lipschitz if and only if
		$$
		\forall x_1,x_2\in D:\;\;\lvert f(x_1)-f(x_2)\rvert\leq\lambda\lvert x_1-x_2\rvert.
		$$
		(see also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity">Wikipedia</a>)
	</div>
</div>
<p>
With that, I can present to you my problem:
</p>
<div class="summary-box">
	<div class="summary-box-title">The Problem</div>
	<div class="summary-box-insides">
		Let \(\lambda\in\rr,\lambda&gt;0,D\subseteq\rr\) with \(D\) bounded and \((f_n)_{n\geq1}\) be a sequence of \(\lambda\)-Lipschitz functions \(f_n:D\to\rr\), which converges <em>pointwise</em> to some \(f:D\to\rr\).<br /><br />

		PROVE OR DISPROVE:<br />
		\((f_n)_{n\geq1}\) also converges to \(f\) <em>uniformly</em>.
