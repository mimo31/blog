<p>
The statement is indeed true and we're about to prove it.
</p>
<h4>Step 1: \(f\) is also \(\lambda\)-Lipschitz</h4>
<p>
Let's start by showing the unsurprising fact that \(f\) is also \(\lambda\)-Lipschitz. For that, let \(x_1,x_2\in D\) be arbitrary. Then we have
$$
\lvert f(x_1)-f(x_2)\rvert=\Big\lvert\lmnf f_n(x_1)-\lmnf f_n(x_2)\Big\rvert=\lmnf\lvert f_n(x_1)-f_n(x_2)\rvert\leq\lambda\lvert x_1-x_2\rvert
$$
exactly as we wanted. The last step works because \(\lvert f_n(x_1)-f_n(x_2)\rvert\leq\lambda\lvert x_1-x_2\rvert\) for all \(n\) by the \(\lambda\)-Lipschitz property of \(f_n\).
</p>
<h4>Step 2: WLOG \(f=0\)</h4>
<p>
Let's define another sequence of functions \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) by
$$
g_n=f_n-f
$$
for all \(n\geq 1\). It is straightforward to see that
<ul>
	<li>
		\((f_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges pointwise to \(f\) if and only \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges pointwise to \(0\) and
	</li>
	<li>
		\((f_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges uniformly to \(f\) if and only if \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges uniformly to \(0\).
	</li>
</ul>
So we know that \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges pointwise to \(0\) and to complete the proof, it suffices to show that \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) also converges to \(0\) uniformly. Besides, I claim that \(g_n\) is \((2\lambda)\)-Lipschitz for all \(n\geq 1\). That's because \(f_n\) and \(-f\) are both \(\lambda\)-Lipschitz and, as you can readily verify, the sum of a \(\lambda_1\)-Lipschitz function and a \(\lambda_2\)-Lipschitz function is \((\lambda_1+\lambda_2)\)-Lipschitz.
</p>
<h4>Step 3: \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges uniformly to \(0\)</h4>
<p>
To show that \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) indeed converges uniformly to \(0\), we pick an arbitrary \(\varepsilon\in\rr,\varepsilon&gt;0\) and we look for \(N\in\nn\) such that for all \(n\geq N\), we have \(\lvert g_n(x)\rvert&lt;\varepsilon\).
</p>
<p>
Since \(D\) is bounded, we can select a <em>finite</em> number of points \(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k\in D\) such that for every point \(x\in D\), there exists \(i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}\) such that \(\lvert x-x_i\rvert&lt;\frac{\varepsilon}{4\lambda}\). Since \((g_n)_{n\geq1}\) converges pointwise to \(0\), we can find \(N_1,N_2,\dots,N_k\in\nn\) such that for each \(i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}\) and for each \(n\geq N_i\), we have \(\lvert g_n(x_i)\rvert&lt;\varepsilon/2\). Now we define
$$
N:=\max_{i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}}N_i
$$
so that we have \(\lvert g_n(x_i)\rvert&lt;\varepsilon/2\) for each \(i\in\{1,2,\dots,k\}\) and \(n\geq N\).
</p>
<p>
Finally, let \(n\geq N\) and \(x\in D\) be arbitrary. From the definition of \(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N\), we know there is \(i\) such that \(\lvert x-x_i\rvert&lt;\frac\varepsilon{4\lambda}\). As \(g_n\) is \((2\lambda)\)-Lipschitz,
$$
\lvert g_n(x)-g_n(x_i)\rvert\leq2\lambda\lvert x-x_i\rvert&lt;\frac\varepsilon2.
$$
That means that
$$
\lvert g_n(x)\rvert=\lvert g_n(x)-g_n(x_i)+g_n(x_i)\rvert\leq\lvert g_n(x)-g_n(x_i)\rvert+\lvert g_n(x_i)\rvert&lt;\varepsilon
$$
as we needed. This completes the proof.
</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>
Note that it was <em>crucial</em> that all \(f_n\) shared the same Lipschitz constant \(\lambda\). The statement wouldn't be true if we only required that \(f_n\) be Lipschitz without specifying the constant. It also wouldn't be true if we dropped the requirement that \(D\) be bounded.

Can you generalize the theorem? Can you improve the proof? Do let me know.
